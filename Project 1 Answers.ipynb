To start and in order to get a visual representation of the data, we can plot each variable as a histogram or as a density plot.  This will give us the general shape of the data.  Next we can use Python's *describe* function in order to know the mean, standard deviation, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.  Using the visual cues from the histograms and knowing that if 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean than the data is normal, we can determine if the data is normal."

We can also use box plots to plot the data and some of python's inherit code will help define potential outliers.\n",

For the values of GRE score and GPA that are outside of these values, we will look at the admit data.

If there is a scalar value such that feature 1 times the scalar is equal to feature 2, then the features are collinear.
